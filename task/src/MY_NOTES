AMCL project is in folder task3 (Sorry about all the other files)

My robot's laser publishes on /scan so I do not remap it. 

I also used teleop much more than move_base. I feel that  
my map doesn't have the "cuts" in the walls to help move_base's trajectory. 

Anyways my focus was on amcl, not on the trajectory mapping part.

Also there's a hardcoded path to the rviz config file (with my name on it) ... you may simply load the rviz config file
if it doesnt load by default for you. (robond/task3/workspace/catkin_ws/src/amcl.rviz, but it searches for home/anupam/robond...) 

For the amcl node, I played and set the following parameters
1. Max particles to 2000 (matches my computation resources ideally)
2. Set initial pose to 0, 0 and set yaw close to the actual yaw of the robot (The zero really makes a difference in the next iteration)
3. Set the recovery alpha (fast, slow) to recommended vals as per the doc
4. Set the laser model type to likelihood with field probability (better than simple likelihood)
5. Played with z_random and z_hit values and settled on a pair with some experimentation

The result is that the localization area is much narrower now. Their is a "tail" effect caused here,
which I could experiment with subsequentally. The small localization area also remains consistent when
the robot moves. I tend to use teleop more than move_base because I feel I have more control.
